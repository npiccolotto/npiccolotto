Hi, Iâ€™m Nikolaus. This is my professional-looking profile, all the goof is at [@prayerslayer](https://github.com/prayerslayer). I have a [website](https://npiccolotto.com) too, just so you know.

I'm currently a PhD student at TU Wien and interested in everything related to data visualization. My niche interests there include ensemble visualization, visual parameter space analysis, set visualization and all data spatio-temporal.
